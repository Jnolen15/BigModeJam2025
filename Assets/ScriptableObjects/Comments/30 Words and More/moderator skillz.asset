  Message: This modderator is so bad its laughable. If I were modded instead this
    stream would be the best in all of the land. My moderating skills are known far
    and wide for being top of the line. No message can get past me unmodderated.
    In fact I an currnetly modding 14 other channels all more popular than yours.
    So moderating here would be something of a walk in the park for a guy like me.
    heh.
