  Message: 'Bee Movie

    By Jerry Seinfeld

    (Black screen with text; The
    sound of buzzing bees can be heard)

    NARRATOR:

    According to all known
    laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are
    too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies
    anyway because bees don''t care what humans think is impossible.
