  Message: 'Fly Movie

    By Berry Scheinfeld

    (Black screen with text; The
    sound of buzzing flies can be heard)

    NARRATOR:

    According to all known
    laws of aviation, there is no way a fly should be able to fly. Its wings are
    too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The fly, of course, flies
    anyway because flies don''t care what humans think is impossible.
