  Message: "Hey so like I\u2019ve been thinking and like honestly\u2026. F#%@ the
    rich.  There is no way for someone to get as wealthy as Schmelon Rusk without
    exploiting the working class, which demonstrates a complete lack of empathy for
    other human beings, and only being interested in filling their own pockets. 
    And on the topic, his Felden Ring build sucks and he clearly paid someone to
    boost his Bridge of Exile 2 account."
