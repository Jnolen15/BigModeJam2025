  Message: 'Own a musket for home defense, since that''s what the founding fathers
    intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered
    wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he''s
    dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because
    it''s smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon
    mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads". just
    as the founding fathers intended.
